# BYD ADB Assistant
This is a helpful GUI utility to sideload apps onto a BYD car using Android Debug Bridge (ADB).

## Installation
You can clone this repository (git clone https://github.com/alahmedi/bydadb) then run either the CLI Script (bydadb.py) or the GUI Script (bydadb_gui.py) easily.

## Usage
### Installing required APKs
You must use this option before using ADB installation. This option downloads the required APKs to a drive of your choosing, which you must plug into the car and install the required APKs from there. The USB must be formatted as FAT32. 
### Installing APKs with ADB
You can enter in the IP of the car (it is found in Settings > Wi-Fi > tap the info button of your connected Wi-Fi network > IP Address), then you select the APKs you want to install.
